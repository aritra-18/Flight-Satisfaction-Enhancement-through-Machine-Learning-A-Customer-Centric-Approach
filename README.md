# FlightSatPredict-Enhancing-Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-through-Machine-Learning
FlightSatPredict is a machine learning project that analyzes Invistico airline customer satisfaction and predicts it accurately, empowering airlines to improve their services based on key factors influencing passenger experience.

Invistico Airline Data Analysis

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict customer satisfaction in the airline industry. Through a series of labs, we explored different models and methodologies to gain insights into the factors influencing customer satisfaction and enhance predictive accuracy. Here are the key takeaways and recommendations. 

**Logistic Regression:**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Machine learning workflows involve data cleaning, encoding, and scaling.
- Logistic regression can produce a relatively good model with a single independent variable, achieving 80.2% accuracy.
**Findings:**
- Logistic regression accurately predicted satisfaction with an 80.2% success rate.
- The confusion matrix demonstrated balanced true positives and true negatives.
**Recommendations to Stakeholders:**
- Improve in-flight entertainment to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Invest in model development to explore additional independent variables for better predictions.

**Decision Trees:**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Data exploration, cleaning, and encoding are essential for model building.
- Visualization of decision trees and feature importance helps identify influential factors.
**Findings:**
- Decision trees achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting satisfaction.
- The confusion matrix revealed a balanced distribution of true positives and true negatives.
- In-flight entertainment, seat comfort, and ease of online booking emerged as the most important features.
**Recommendations to Stakeholders:**
- Enhance in-flight entertainment, seat comfort, and ease of online booking to improve customer satisfaction.
- Invest in further model development and understanding to leverage the predictive power of decision trees.

**Random Forest:**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Model evaluation is crucial to determine predictive accuracy.
- F1 scores are more informative than accuracy scores when the cost of false positives and false negatives differs.
**Findings:**
- Random forest achieved outstanding accuracy of over 94.2%, with precision and recall exceeding 95%.
- Random forest outperformed decision trees, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- XGBoost, an advanced boosting algorithm, also yielded excellent results, showcasing its potential for improved accuracy.\
- Seat comfort emerged as a highly influential factor.
**Recommendations to Stakeholders:**
- Prioritize improvements in seat comfort, in addition to in-flight entertainment and ease of online booking.
- Leverage the success of the random forest and XGBoost models for better customer satisfaction prediction.

By sharing these findings and recommendations with stakeholders, we aim to improve overall customer satisfaction in the airline industry. The repository includes code, analysis, and visualizations to support the project's insights and conclusions. We encourage you to explore the repository to gain a deeper understanding of our methodology and findings.

# FlightSatPredict-Enhancing-Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-through-Machine-Learning
FlightSatPredict is a machine learning project that analyzes Invistico airline customer satisfaction and predicts it accurately, empowering airlines to improve their services based on key factors influencing passenger experience.

Invistico Airline Data Analysis

This project aimed to predict customer satisfaction with an airline using machine learning techniques. The dataset was explored, cleaned, and encoded for modeling. A random forest model was built and compared to a decision tree model with optimized hyperparameters.

Key Takeaways:

- Data exploration, cleaning, and encoding are vital for preparing the data.
- Use a separate validation set for unbiased model evaluation.
- F1 scores provide more informative evaluation, especially when costs of false positives and false negatives differ.
- The random forest model outperformed the decision tree model, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Important factors for customer satisfaction: "Inflight entertainment," "Seat comfort," and "Ease of Online booking."

The random forest model demonstrated superior performance, indicating its potential for accurate prediction. Improving "Inflight entertainment," "Seat comfort," and "Ease of Online booking" can enhance customer satisfaction. Further investment in model building is recommended. Refer to the accompanying documentation for code and analysis.

# FlightSatPredict-Enhancing-Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-through-Machine-Learning
FlightSatPredict is a machine learning project that analyzes Invistico airline customer satisfaction and predicts it accurately, empowering airlines to improve their services based on key factors influencing passenger experience.

INVISTICO AIRLINE DATA ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
The objective of this project was to build a predictive model to determine customer satisfaction with an airline. The project involved data exploration, cleaning, and encoding to prepare the data for modeling. A random forest model was developed and compared against a decision tree model with the best hyperparameters.
The key takeaways from this project are as follows:
    •	Data exploration, cleaning, and encoding are crucial steps in preparing the data for model building.
    •	It is recommended to use a separate validation set for model tuning to avoid bias in evaluation.
    •	F1 scores are more informative than accuracy scores, especially when the costs of false positives and false negatives differ        significantly.
    •	The random forest model outperformed the decision tree model, demonstrating superior predictive performance.
The random forest model achieved impressive results, with over 94.2% accuracy, precision exceeding 95%, and recall approximately 94.5%. These metrics indicate that the model is highly accurate in predicting customer satisfaction. The random forest model consistently outperformed the tuned decision tree model in all evaluation scores, suggesting its potential for better performance.
Additionally, stakeholders expressed interest in understanding the factors most important to customer satisfaction. The feature importance analysis of the tuned random forest model identified "Inflight entertainment," "Seat comfort," and "Ease of Online booking" as the most influential factors.       In summary, the findings from this project suggest that improving the customer experience in terms of "Inflight entertainment," "Seat comfort," and "Ease of Online booking" can significantly enhance customer satisfaction. The high predictive accuracy of the model emphasizes the need for further investment in model building and understanding.
